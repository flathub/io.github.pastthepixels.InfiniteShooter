    <summary>A simplistic shooter made with the Godot engine.</summary>
    <description>
        <p>
          InfiniteShooter is a simplistic shooter game made with Godot. There's only one goal: survive for as long as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The controls are easy to understand too. All you need to know is how to move your ship and fire a laser.
          Using these controls, you can experience InfiniteShooter's simple yet addicting gameplay--which might have you playing for longer than you should!
        </p>
          As the game progresses, more enemy types will be introduced and game mechanics may even change.
          However, when you die, your score is logged and all progress is reset!
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, this game is fully free-and-open-source, in both meanings of free!
          Not only are all the assets public domain with CC-0 licenses, but the game itself is licensed under the GNU GPL v3, meaning you're free to modify and help improve the source code of the game.
          There's no in-app purchases and no cheap tricks. When you get the game, you get the whole game, for free. 
        </p>
